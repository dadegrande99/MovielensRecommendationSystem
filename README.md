# Recommendation System for Movielens100k

Undergraduate project of the course [Business Management Information Methods](https://elearning.unimib.it/course/info.php?id=37045#en) (BSc in Computer Science at [University of Study in Milan-Bicocca](https://en.unimib.it/)).

This project focuses on analyzing the Movielens 100k dataset to develop a recommendation system based on K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbors). The key phases include:

- **Data Acquisition**: Utilization of the Movielens 100k dataset containing 100,000 movie ratings from 943 users, along with demographic information.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Examination of user characteristics (age, gender, occupation) and movie features (genres) to understand their influence on ratings.
- **Recommendation System**: Implementation of the K-NN algorithm to predict missing ratings, optimizing the hyperparameter K, and utilizing similarity metrics such as Cosine Similarity and Pearson Correlation.
- **Clustering**: Grouping users into clusters based on the similarity of their ratings to improve personalized recommendations.

The objective is to comprehend user preferences and deliver targeted recommendations.
